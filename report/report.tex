\newpage

% Basically, your report should provide documentation for your source files. I should be able to read your report, and then look at your source code without having to wonder 'what does is function/lemma/property for?' You can assume I am somewhat familiar with the pearls, but it's probably best to explain too much rather than too little. There is no fixed page length, but I'd expect you need more than two pages, but less than twenty.

\section{Problem Description}
\label{sec:prob-desc}
% a brief description of the problem you worked on;

\section{Implementation in Coq}
\label{sec:impl}
% a description of how you implemented the functions from your paper in Coq. What was hard? Is all the recursion structural? Or were there missing case branches? What design decisions did you make at this point;

\section{Reasoning about the Solver}
\label{sec:reas}
% a description of the specification or properties that these functions satisfy. How far did you get with all the proofs? Were there any properties that were especially hard/easy to prove? Did you require any auxiliary lemmas?

\section{Conclusions and Further Work}
\label{sec:conc}
% a conclusion, reflecting on your work. What would be needed to finish this project? What would you do differently next time?
